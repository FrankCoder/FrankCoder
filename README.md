- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrankCoder, I'm a full stack developer and I have been coding for work and pleasure for over 30 years (that's when I stopped counting). 
- 👀 I now am setting up my own small software company: Signature Software.
- I’m interested in progressive web apps
- 🌱 I’m continuousy learning about new technologies.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on other projects at this time, not that I couldn't be convinced otherwise.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, there's enough info here to find me on the net if you feel like it.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @FrankCoder, I'm a full stack developer and I have been coding for work and pleasure for over 30 years (that's when I stopped counting). 
- 👀 I manage technical (professional) services teams for several product lines at Upland Software. Now I mostly code for my own benefit. 
I’m interested in progressive web apps
- 🌱 I’m continuousy learning about new technologies.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on other projects at this time, not that I couldn't be convinced otherwise.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, there's enough info here to find me on the net if you feel like it.
